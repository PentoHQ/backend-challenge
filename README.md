# Pento Backend challenge

The company Pento wants to automate the payroll calculation for its employees.

Each employee has a yearly gross salary, and on top of that, the company can give a net monthly bonus at his discretion.

Pento is a multinational corporation based in Italy, 
and it is expanding in France, and the employee can be hired only in one of those two countries, 
to calculate the net salary each of the countries has a different process:

- Italy:
    - The employee has 14 salaries per year; August and December have an extra salary
    - The employee pays 25% of taxes
    - The employee pays 7% for the national health insurance
- France:
    - The employee has 12 salaries per year
    - The employee pays 30% of taxes
    - The employee does not pay for a national health insurance

Pento wants to have a payroll summary each month for every employee with the gross/net salary breakdown.

Keep in mind that there are two kinds of payrolls current/past payrolls named "Real Payroll" and future payrolls named "Future Preview".

Pento is a tech company and needs to have an API server to serve this purpose.

but feel free to use any other technology you think is needed explaining your reason behind the choice you did.

Give us an implementation that has idiomatic code and has reasons for your decisions.
